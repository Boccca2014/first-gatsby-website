This is my first blog post! Isn't it *great*?

Some of my **favorite** things are:

* Cream-colored ponies (and)
* crisp apple strudels...
* Doorbells and sleigh bells (and)
* schnitzel with noodles

...When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad!
Sorry I had to.
